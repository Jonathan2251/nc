CNN
----

CNN: They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, 
image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing, and 
financial time series [#cnnwiki]_.

Concept about how to apply Convolution and MaxPool to getting features from image [#selectedpattern]_.
Conv+MaxPool -> get features map and downsize image, more Conv+MaxPool can filter image and higher 
level of features and downsize more image. CNN model used in image recognition.

Concept and data applying in Deap Learning for different models of CNN [#onnxmodelzoo]_.
